# flac2all archive

This branch just holds version2 of flac2all (back then just called "convertaudio"), primarily for archival and historic purposes (and because I stumbled upon it by accident while clearing out old backup folders). Vintage 2006.

This was the first multiprocess version that supported tagging of lame mp3, and the first that was published online under the GPL for public use. If you look at the mp3 class, you will notice that it has not changed much.  The mp3 code is pretty much the oldest code in flac2all (as of version 4).
