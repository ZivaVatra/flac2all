# flac2all archive

This branch just holds the version2 copy of flac2all (then just called "convertaudio"), primarily for archival and historic purporses (and I stumbled upon it by accident). Vintage 2006.

This was the first multiprocess version that supported tagging of lame mp3, and the first that was published online under the GPL for public use. If you look at the mp3 class, you will notice that it has not changed much. That is very much the oldest code in flac2all at this point in time.
